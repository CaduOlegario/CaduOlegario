# Welcome to my Development Universe! 👋

Hello, nice to meet you! I'm Cadu. 😊 I'm a Mid-Level Front-end Developer, and my journey has taken me through challenging and rewarding paths. Working in startups, I immersed myself in the world of innovation and speed, learning the importance of being proactive and adaptable. While in larger companies, I had the chance to explore the vast universe of corporate structures, gaining in-depth insights into business mechanisms and the value of organizational culture.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies I Master

- **ReactJS, NextJS, and Typescript**: Crafting modern and responsive interfaces.
- **Git and Scrum**: Organization and efficiency in processes.
- **CSS, Styled Component, Tailwind CSS, and Sass**: Bringing pages to life with style.
- **Axios, NodeJS, MySQL, and Mongo**: Connecting and managing data with precision.

I believe in the power of collaboration and am always on the lookout for new opportunities to broaden my horizons, learn, and contribute even more to the tech community. If you're looking for someone committed, creative, and with a holistic view of development, it would be great to chat! 🚀

Let's build something amazing together! 🔧✨
